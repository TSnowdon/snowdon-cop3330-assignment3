Define the input file as "INPUT_FILE";
Define a list of Frequency as "wordFrequencies";
Construct a new WordFinder as "finder" leave outputFile as null;
    "finder" reads "INPUT_FILE";
        once queried "finder" will start a loop;
             for each line of data in "INPUT_FILE";
             store it within the finder;
        end loop;
    count the amount of times "snake", "badger" and "mushroom" appear;
        for each word that you are searching for;
            ask the finder to count the number of times they appear;
            once queried "finder" will start a loop;
            for each line of data in "INPUT_FILE";
                split the line into an array of Strings;
                    iterate over the array;
                        if any array matches the targeted word;
                            add to the count;
            end loop;
            return count;
        Add the Frequency of that word to "wordFrequencies";
        end loop;
    print the a histogram based off of the frequencies;
        for each Frequency;
            print the name of the word and a bar that is "count" long;
