Start Program
Define the input file as "INPUT_FILE";
Construct a new WordFinder as "finder";
    "finder" reads "INPUT_FILE" and then asks the user where to output;
    once queried "finder" will start a loop;
    for each line of data in "INPUT_FILE";
        store it within the finder;
    end loop;
Ask "finder" to find "utilize" and replace it with "use";
    "finder" dumps the previous data;
    for each line of data in "INPUT_FILE";
        store it and replace instances of "utilize" with "use";
    end loop;
write the data to previously defined output file;
End Program
